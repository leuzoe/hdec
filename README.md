## Python module for the "Heidelberg Energy Control" Wallbox 

This python module aims at controlling the "Heidelberg Energy Control" Wallbox 
via its Modbus interface. A special goal is providing a module for the 
openWB software.

You may install this python module on your openWB Raspi, connect your 
Heidelberg via a cheap RS485/USB adapter, apply some configuration and then use 
the Wallbox as charging point in openWB.
